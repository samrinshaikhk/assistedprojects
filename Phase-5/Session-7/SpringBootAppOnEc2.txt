*******Deploy Spring Boot Application on AWS Instance **********

Step 1: create springboot application

	> simple create a controller
	> implement get mapping
		@getMapping("/)
		public String hello(){
			return "Hellooo from AWS";
		}
	> add @componentScan in Application
	> run application and check whether it is working fine or not
	> run app as maven install
	> which is going to create Jar file in target folder

Step 2: create Instance on AWS EC2
	>in security group add rule with TCP and give port no: 8080
	> keep that .pem with you

Step 3: connect with your instance using mobaxterm
	> copy .pem file in one folder
	> move to that folder using mobaXterm
	> execute that ssh command (you can copy the same from your ssh client)
	> ssh -i "test.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-226-72-13.compute-1.amazonaws.com

	> connected with EC2

Step 4: drag your jar file to this mobaXterm

(Note: If not using mobaXterm then follow this command to copy jar file from your local machine to EC2)
(execute from your local machine)
scp -i <path of your .pem file> <path of your jar file> ec2-user@ec2-54-226-72-13.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~

Step 5: install JDK 1.8 
	sudo yum install java-1.8.0

	it will propmt ? yes

	after installation: sudo java -version

Step 6: run your Jar file
	java -jar name_of_your_jar.jar 

	publicId:8080
